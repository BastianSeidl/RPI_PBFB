# RPI_PBFB
#This code, together with the PBFB ("Pliensbachian Foraminifera Buttenheim") data frame was created for
#Research Project Implementation in the 2. Semester of Master Geoscience at FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg. 

#Output: 
#Shapiro_Result: p-values to check, whether the individual samples,are non-parametric distributed
#Boxplot for Length, Width and Geometric Mean per sample to show the overlap between samples
#Kruskal and Dune Results for samples of original size, to show their significant differences
#Sub_PBFB_result: p-values to check, whether test results are an artifact of sample size
